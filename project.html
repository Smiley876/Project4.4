    <h2 id="h2"> Reading</h2>
    <img src="reading.jpg" alt="reading artwork" id="i2">
<p id="p2">Reading is a good hobby because it improves our mental health, general knowledge,<br> writing skills and you can even make a career out of it. Reading can be considered as an <br> indirect screen time detox, since you will lessen your screen time by reading physical books.<br>
Even if you choose to read using an e-reader like kindle, it is not as harsh on the eyes <br> compared to your laptop or phone. The mind will sharpen from all the plots we’ve read, <br> characters we engage with and words we’ve learned.
The mind is like a sponge. <br> The more we read, the more we absorb and the more knowledgeable we become.<br> Reading can also be relaxing especially for stressfull adults.</p>

    <h2 id="h3">Hiking</h2>
    <img src="hiking.webp" alt="hike" id="i3">
<pre id="p3" style="color:white;">Like any form of physical activity, hiking for extended periods will activate almost every muscle in your body. <br>It helps to promote flexibility, strength, and endurance both on and off the hiking trail. <br> On the trail, you’ll be challenged with coordination, balance, and endurance.<br> While off the trail, you may be challenged to commit to body aftercare such as stretching. <br>Hiking can also help with your internal health by reducing blood pressure and increasing your physical endurance.<br> Getting out of the house, getting in touch with nature and taking in the natural landscape around you can often be a very grounding experience that may help to give you a sobering perspective on life. <br>When you take the time to reconnect with nature, you’re ultimately reconnecting to yourself. <br>Spending time out on hikes and in nature has been shown to help regulate your circadian rhythm, which is crucial if you want to get a good night’s sleep.<br> Plus the extra exposure to oxygen from all that time under the trees can help you slip into a more restful and rejuvenating quality of sleep.<br> And you’ll have the added bonus of increased energy level when you wake up.</pre>

    <h2 id="h2">Sketching & Painting</h2>
    <img src="painting.jpeg" alt="paint" id="i4">
<p id="p4">Holding a paintbrush triggers your mind to start imagining. Your brain works precisely to<br> envision vivid colors, striking places, people, and a lot. <br> Often you end up representing your emotions via your art. Artistic skills play a significant role in <br>the overall development of the brain. Involving oneself in some creative work quickly<br> releases stress, and calms the temper.For people having memory issues, <br>creating masterpieces with colors could be the finest thing. Painting boosts your memory skills. <br>People who are involved in drawing, writing, and painting are at a lower risk of developing <br>memory-related illnesses during their older age. Drawing is a perfect way to express <br>inner emotions and feelings without words. One can easily overcome shyness and <br>bump-up self-confidence. It has been seen that people who are involved in a creative<br> activity have better consciousness as compared to the ones who don’t.<br> So, pick up the brush and start painting your imaginations.Since art is the only way to<br> express feelings without verbal communication, one can project their unutterable emotions <br>through art activities such as turning photo to portraits. Art is effective in helping people break free from their personal limitations. It enables individuals to surpass their weaknesses, which include shyness, autism, and other disabilities.</p>

    <h2 id="h5">Playing Chess</h2>
    <img src="chess.jpeg" alt="chess" id="i5">
<p id="p5">Skilled chess players learn to anticipate an opponent’s next moves. To predict what another person <br>will do next, a player must develop the ability to adopt another person’s perspective and infer what <br>action they are likely to take.
Behavioral scientists call this this ability to see from another viewpoint<br> the “theory of mind.” It’s an ability that is essential to exercising empathy and building healthy social<br> relationships. The game involves memorizing numerous combinations of moves and their potential <br> outcomes. Flow is a deeply rewarding sense of total involvement, in which you’re operating at a peak<br> performance level in a challenging task. Athletes, artists, and performers often describe entering a kind <br>of time warp, where they are so wholly focused on the task at hand that their awareness of anything <br>beyond the performance seems to disappear.</p>

    <h2 id="h6"><abbr title="*To address these concerns and maximize the benefits of treating sleep as a hobby, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced
approach.*"> Sleeping</abbr></h2>
<img src="sleeping.gif" alt="sleep" id="i6">
    <pre id="p6" style="color:white;">The time investment in sleep-related activities is another factor that aligns sleep with more traditional hobbies. <br>Sleep enthusiasts often dedicate significant portions of their day to researching sleep techniques, optimizing their sleep environment, and analyzing their sleep data. <br>This level of commitment goes beyond the basic act of sleeping and enters the realm of hobby-like dedication. <br>Experimenting with sleep schedules is another common practice among sleep hobbyists. Some individuals explore alternative sleep patterns, such as polyphasic sleep or dedicated sleep schedules, in an attempt to optimize their rest and potentially increase their waking hours. <br> While these experiments should be approached with caution and under professional guidance, they demonstrate the level of engagement and curiosity that many sleep enthusiasts bring to their pursuit.<br> While the idea of sleep as a hobby may seem unconventional, there are numerous potential benefits to this approach.<br> Perhaps the most obvious is improved sleep quality and quantity. By dedicating time and effort to optimizing their sleep, enthusiasts often experience more restful nights and wake up feeling more refreshed. <br>This improvement in sleep can have far-reaching effects on overall health and well-being. Enhanced overall health is a significant benefit of prioritizing sleep. <br>Increased productivity and cognitive function are often reported by those who prioritize sleep. When well-rested,individuals tend to experience improved focus, creativity, and problem-solving abilities.</pre>
